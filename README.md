## Maize Tassel Detector

This is a flask backend with a custom model with a simple nextjs frontend that allows you to drag and drop or select files for upload for maize tassel detection.

Winner of [CUCAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/canadian-undergraduate-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/posts/?feedView=all) 2023, the largest Canadian Undergrad Conference in AI.

Partnered with [Distributive](https://distributive.network/) and [University of Nairobi](https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/) to deliver a solution to accelerate the yield estimation process for maize farmers. They used to count them manually!

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Setup the backend via [Backend Readme](https://github.com/RelativelyFine/Inferencing-Interface/blob/main/Backend/README.md)
- Setup the frontend via [Frontend Readme](https://github.com/RelativelyFine/Inferencing-Interface/blob/main/Frontend/README.md)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to interact with the app.

(Endpoints are hosted at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000))

### Note:

Currently Using YoloV8n on a custom trained tensor for parking detection. This will be changed to the proper model in the future.
